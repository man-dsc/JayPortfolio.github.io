								<h3>Early Life and School</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Born and raised in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, I developed a passion for technology and problem-solving early on. 
								I graduated with distinction in Electrical Engineering (Computer Engineering minor), earning a 3.5/4.0 cGPA. During my studies, I explored 
								fascinating courses like Databases and Neuro-Fuzzy & Soft Computing, a machine learning course that introduced me 
								to the power of data science. These courses not only provided me with foundational technical skills but also sparked a 
								deep interest in applying technology to solve real-world problems. For my final project in machine learning, I combined 
								computer vision and convolutional neural networks to create a weather-registration system that helped users prepare their
								 clothing for the day based on predicted conditions.

									<h3>Work Experience</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									I have worked in the software industry, including roles in the oil and gas and tech sectors, 
									where I honed my skills in software development. While these positions provided valuable experience, 
									I wanted to move beyond these roles and explore opportunities that aligned more closely with 
									my interests and goals, in data science and business intelligence. This shift led me on a journey of exploration—completing courses in finance, 
									learning new languages, and even working in sales.
								</p>

									<h3>Plans for the Future</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									I thrive in data science and business intelligence, combining tools like Excel and Python to analyze trends, solve challenges, and create impactful solutions. 
									Moving forward, I plan to share these projects on my GitHub, showcasing how emerging tools and techniques can be leveraged to solve real-world challenges and create meaningful impact.
									My passion for learning and building practical projects fuels my ability to adapt and tackle diverse problems—let's explore how I can help address yours.
