								<h3>Early Life and School</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Born and raised in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, I developed a passion for technology and problem-solving early on. 
								I graduated with distinction from my undergraduate program, earning a 3.5/4.0 GPA. During my studies, I explored 
								fascinating courses like Databases and Neuro-Fuzzy & Soft Computing, a machine learning course that introduced me 
								to the power of data science. These courses not only provided me with foundational technical skills but also sparked a 
								deep interest in applying technology to solve real-world problems. For my final project in machine learning, I combined 
								computer vision and convolutional neural networks to create a weather-registration system that helped users prepare their
								 clothing for the day based on predicted conditions.

									<h3>Work Experience</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									I have worked in the software industry, including roles in the oil and gas and tech sectors, 
									where I honed my skills in software development. While these positions provided valuable experience, 
									I realized I wanted to move beyond these roles and explore opportunities that aligned more closely with 
									my interests and goals. This shift led me on a journey of explorationâ€”completing course in finance, 
									learning new languages, and even working in sales. Each step brought new insights, but I struggled to find 
									a career that truly fulfilled me.
								</p>

									<h3>Plans for the Future</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Eventually, I recognized that the field of data science and business intelligence was a natural fit for both my skills and personality.
									I have a habit of using tools like Excel and Python to track and analyze various aspects of my life. For example, I've created spreadsheets to track 
									job applications and their outcomes, scraping and plotting car price trends from Facebook Marketplace and websites to calculate metrics like cost per horsepower, helping me make data-driven decisions.
									This analytical mindset and passion for extracting meaning from data inspire me to tackle challenges and create impactful solutions.								
								
								</p>
								<p>
									I am a lifelong learner, constantly exploring new technologies and building projects that enhance my personal life.
									Whether it's streamlining daily tasks or experimenting with innovative ideas, I thrive on discovering practical applications for technology.
									Moving forward, I plan to share these projects on my GitHub, showcasing how emerging tools and techniques can be leveraged to solve real-world challenges and create meaningful impact.
